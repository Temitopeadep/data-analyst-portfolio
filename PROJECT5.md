# SQL â€“ Superstore Database & Analytics
## Project Overview
This project involved designing and analyzing a Superstore Database from scratch using Microsoft SQL Server. It was a hands-on way to strengthen my skills in database modeling, data cleaning, and SQL-based business analytics.

## What I Worked On
1. Designed a normalized database schema.
2. Imported and cleaned raw Superstore data.
3. Populated tables using the INSERT method with mock data.
4. Wrote complex SQL queries to extract business insights.

 ## Database Schema
The database contained 4 main tables:
- CUSTOMER
- ORDERS
- ORDER STATUS
- USERS


## Key SQL Queries & Insights

1. Total Revenue per Order by Customer.
   -  Showed how much revenue each order generated per customer.
   -  Useful for identifying top clients.

2. Top 10 Product-Customer Combinations by Profit
   - Identified the most profitable product-customer-region combinations.
   - Supports strategic targeting.

3. Top 20 High-Volume Orders by Category
   - Highlighted product categories driving large-volume orders.
   - Valuable for inventory planning.

3. Top 20 Orders with Customer Details & Date Filter
   - Focused on recent high-volume orders by customer and category.
   - Great for spotting trends and bulk buyers.
