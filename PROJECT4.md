# Titanic Survival Analysis  

## Project Overview  
This project explores the famous Titanic dataset using **Python** and **pandas** to uncover survival patterns among passengers. The analysis provides insights into demographics, ticket class, and embarkation points that influenced survival rates.  

## Objectives  
- Analyze passenger data to uncover survival trends  
- Explore the impact of sex, class, and embarkation point on survival rates  
- Strengthen data wrangling and visualization skills  

## Tools & Libraries  
- **Python**  
- **pandas** for data manipulation  
- **matplotlib** and **seaborn** for data visualization  

## Key Insights  
- **Survival Rate by Sex**: Female passengers had a significantly higher survival rate compared to males.  
- **Overall Survival Rate**: About **38%** of passengers survived the tragedy.  
- **Survival Rate by Class**: First-class passengers had the highest survival rate, while third-class passengers faced the most risk.  
- **Embarkation Points**: Most passengers boarded from Southampton, followed by Cherbourg and Queenstown.  

## Visualizations  
The project includes visualizations such as:  
- Survival rate by gender  
- Survival rate across passenger classes  
- Survival distribution by embarkation points  
- Overall survival percentage

## Learning Outcomes  
This project helped me:  
- Practice data cleaning, transformation, and analysis using **pandas**  
- Improve visualization skills with **matplotlib** and **seaborn**  
- Translate raw data into meaningful insights about a historical event
